# NgxEasyRouting

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.


## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.





## Running Tests

This project uses [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) and [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/) for unit tests.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
The test results will appear in the terminal. By default, the ng test command launches the Karma test runner in watch mode. The tests will re-run whenever you save changes to the test files.

For a single run of the tests without watch mode, you can use:
`ng test --watch=false`

Please note that you need to have the Angular CLI installed globally on your machine to use ng commands. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so with this command:
`npm install -g @angular/cli`


## Debugging Tests
When tests fail, the error message should give you some indication of what went wrong. You can also use console.log statements in your tests to help debug issues. These will output to your terminal.

To debug tests in a browser environment, you can use:
`ng test --browsers=ChromeDebug`

This will keep the browser open and you can use the browser's developer tools for debugging.
